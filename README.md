How to do the cheapest computing. A bake-off in the spirit of Moore's law, which is really about money.

> With unit cost falling as the number of components per circuit rises, by 1975 economics may dictate squeezing as many as 65,000 components on a single silicon chip

> For simple circuits, the cost per component is nearly inversely proportional to the number of components,

> But as components are added, decreased yields more than compensate for the increased complexity, tending to raise the cost per component.

> But the minimum is rising rapidly while the entire cost curve is falling (see graph below).

> The total cost of making a particular system function must be minimized. To do so, we could amortize the engineering over several identical items, or evolve flex- ible techniques for the engineering of large functions so that no disproportionate expense need be borne by a particular array.

Various quotes about costs from Goordon Moore's 1965 paper
[Cramming more components onto integrated circuits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By83v5TWkGjvQkpBcXJKT1I1TTA/view)
, which came to be known as *Moore's Law*.
